  year = {2005},
  abstract = { The software gap - the discrepancy between the need for new software and the aggregate capacity of the workforce to produce it - is a serious problem for scientific software. Although users appreciate the convenience (and, thus, improved productivity) of using relatively high-level scripting languages, the slow execution speeds of these languages remain a problem. Lower level languages, such as C and Fortran, provide better performance for production applications, but at the cost of tedious programming and optimization by experts. If applications written in scripting languages could be routinely compiled into highly optimized machine code, a huge productivity advantage would be possible. It is not enough, however, to simply develop excellent compiler technologies for scripting languages (as a number of projects have succeeded in doing for MATLAB). In practice, scientists typically extend these languages with their own domain-centric components, such as the MATLAB signal processing toolbox. Doing so effectively defines a new domain-specific language. If we are to address efficiency problems for such extended languages, we must develop a framework for automatically generating optimizing compilers for them. To accomplish this goal, we have been pursuing an innovative strategy that we call telescoping languages. Our approach calls for using a library-preprocessing phase to extensively analyze and optimize collections of libraries that define an extended language. Results of this analysis are collected into annotated libraries and used to generate a library-aware optimizer. The generated library-aware optimizer uses the knowledge gathered during preprocessing to carry out fast and effective optimization of high-level scripts. This enables script optimization to benefit from the intense analysis performed during preprocessing without repaying its price. Since library preprocessing is performed only at infrequent "language-generation" times, its cost is amortized over many compilations of individual scripts that use the library. We call this strategy "telescoping languages" because it merges knowledge of a hierarchy of extended languages into a single library-aware optimizer. We present our vision and plans for compiler frameworks based on telescoping languages and - report on the preliminary research that has established the effectiveness of this approach. },

   abstract ="Despite its name, automatic differentiation (AD) is
              often far from an automatic process. Often one must
              specify independent and dependent variables, indicate
              the derivative quantities to be computed, and perhaps
              even provide information about the structure of the
              Jacobians or Hessians being computed. When AD is used in
              conjunction with a toolkit with well-defined interfaces,
              however, many of these issues can be dealt with
              automatically. We describe recent research into coupling
              the ADIC automatic differentiation tool with PETSc, a
              toolkit for the parallel numerical solution of
              PDEs. This research leverages the interfaces and objects
              of PETSc to make the AD process very nearly invisible.",

  abstract =    "This guide describes the use of the Automatic
                 Differentiation in C (ADIC) system. ADIC is a suite of
                 tools and libraries that automates the process of
                 generating derivatives for scientific programs. In the
                 context of solving PDEs, optimizations, sensitivity
                 analysis, and inverse problems, researchers often
                 require the derivatives @f=@x of a function f expressed
                 as a program with respect to some input parameter(s) x.
                 Automatic differentiation (AD) techniques augment the
                 program with derivative computation by applying the
                 chain rule of calculus to elementary operations in an
                 automated fashion. ADIC uses sophisticated compiler
                 techniques to augment the input C programs with
                 derivative computation capability in an automatic
                 fashion. It also provides a finer control of derivative
                 code generation process via control scripts and
                 pragmas. Another significant capability of ADIC is its
                 component architecture, AIF, that allows ADIC's
                 capability to be extended via plug-in modules.",

  abstract =    "We describe a simple component architecture for the
                 development of tools for mathematically based semantic
                 transformations of scientific software. This
                 architecture consists of compiler-based,
                 language-specific front- and backends for source
                 transformation, loosely coupled with one or more
                 language-independent {"}plug-in{"} transformation
                 modules. The coupling mechanism between the front- and
                 back-ends and transformation modules is provided by the
                 XML Abstract Interface Form (XAIF). XAIF provides an
                 abstract, language-independent representation of
                 language constructs common in imperative languages,
                 such as C and Fortran. We describe the use of this
                 architecture in the construction of tools for automatic
                 differentiation (AD) of programs written in Fortran 77
                 and ANSI C. The XAIF is particularly well suited for
                 performing the source transformations needed for AD.
                 Differentiation modules typically operate within the
                 scope of statements or basic blocks, working at a level
                 where procedural languages are very similar. Thus, it
                 is possible to specify a common interface format for
                 mathematically-based semantic transformations that need
                 not represent the union of all languages.",
